# Gender-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
This project is a gender classification system that uses machine learning techniques to predict the gender of individuals based on their facial features. It serves as a demonstration of applying image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to a real-world problem.

## Features:
- Utilizes mchine learning models to extract meaningful facial features from images.
- Trains a gender classification model using a dataset of labeled facial images.
- Implements image preprocessing techniques for enhancing model performance.
- Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the trained model for gender prediction.

## Technologies and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pillow for image processing
- TensorFlow for model training
- Flask for building the user interface
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web-based interfaces

## Installation and Usage:
1. Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/your-username/gender-classification.git](https://github.com/ro-26/gender-classification-using-machine-learning)
2. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv env
3. Activate the virtual environment: env\Scripts\activate
4. Install the required dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Set FLASK_APP = app.py
6. flask run
7. Access the user interface through a web browser: http://localhost:5000
